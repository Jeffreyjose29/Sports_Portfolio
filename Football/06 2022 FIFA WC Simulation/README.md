## Overview

The **2022 FIFA World Cup** was an international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of FIFA's member associations and 22nd edition of the FIFA World Cup that was won by the Argentina national football team. It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, making it the first World Cup held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. France were the defending champions, having defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 final.

This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate, the event was held during November and December. It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. The Qatar national football team entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.

## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to create a simulation model for the FIFA World Cup 2022 held in Qatar. Key Metrics relating to each team is focused on such as the attack, defense and midfield as well as recent form.

The project is completed using R as the primary language.

## Data Sources

1. **Confederation Data:** Wikipedia
2. **FIFA Ranking:** Kaggle *(FIFAWORLDRANKING - Cashncarry)*
3. **Players:** *Kaggle (FIFA 23 Complete Player Dataset - Cashncarry)*
4. **International Matches:** NA

## Simulation Method

Each match of the world-cup was simulated 500 times and the world cup was simulated 100 times in order to get the winner and the most common reach for each time in the competition.

**Our results suggest that Brazil are the eventual winners of the competition with France being the runners-up. Both Argentina and Portugal are expected to make the semi-finals in what is most probably Cristiano Ronaldo's and Lionel Messi's Final world-cup capping off an incredible career.**

## Actual World-Cup Results

**Argentina** were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well being the first nation from South America to win the tournament since 2002. French player Kylian Mbappé became the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 final and won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals (eight) during the tournament. Argentine captain Lionel Messi was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball. Teammates Emiliano Martínez and Enzo Fernández won the Golden Glove, awarded to the tournament's best goalkeeper, and the Young Player Award, awarded to the tournament's best young player, respectively. The tournament, with 172 goals, set a new record for the highest number of goals scored with the 32 team format.

### Argentina Road To Championship

## Simulation vs. Actual

Overall I would like to think that the simulation model produced has worked well overall given the high number of upsets in this tournament and unexpected. A clear example of this is Morocco who were tipped to finish bottom a group which consisted of Canada, Belgium and Croatia given their world ranking and previous matches. However, they provided the shock run of the tournament by beating big teams such as Portugal and Spain to reach the semi-finals before falling 2-0 to France. 

The winners of our simulation Brazil exited the tournament in the round of 16 with a shock loss to Croatia on penalties as they conceded 4 minutes before full-time. This then made Argentina the favorites to life the coveted trophy.

Our simulation had predicted both France and Argentina to reach the semi-finals which was as it happened and we predicted France to be the second finalist playing Brazil in the final. Although Brazil did not make the finals, we did estimate France to reach the backend of the competition accurately. 

Overall this has been a fun project and helped me to engage more with the world-cup and I think the results we have obtained from our simulation is not too bad considering the overall flow of the tournaments given shock results, early player injuries and so on.
